## Background

In this project, I envisioned myself as a data analyst at McDonald's Corporation. I was given a messy, raw dataset with the task of helping managers and senior leadership understand what was happening within seven European countries before their 2023 annual meeting. 

### Methodology

I obtained data from CareerPrinciples.com and then conducted data manipulation in Excel.

#### Excel techniques used:
- Pivot Tables 
- Pivot Charts
- Dynamic Named Ranges
- Data Validation 
- Conditional Formatting
- IF, VLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH, and SUMIFS formulas
- Slicers for interactivity
- Dashboard layout and formatting best practices
